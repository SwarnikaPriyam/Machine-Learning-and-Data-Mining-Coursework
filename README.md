# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining-Coursework
The coursework included two classification problems for Water Quality and Mushroom Classifications. To implement ILP, the Pyrimidine SAR (structure-activity relationship) problem and to implement reinforcement learning, the mountain car problem had been chosen.

The Set Up Instructions are included in the file Data_Divas_MLDM_Set_Up.docx.

The Report file with all the details are included in the file Data_Divas_MLDM_Report.pdf. 

This group coursework was implemented by five members in a team from the University of Surrey, 2021-2022.
