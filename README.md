# Machine-Learning-and-Data-Mining-Coursework
This group coursework was implemented by five members in a team from the University of Surrey, 2021-2022.

The Set Up Instructions are included in the file Data_Divas_MLDM_Set_Up.

The Report file with all the details are included in the file Data_Divas_MLDM_Report. 

Three datasets, namely, Water Quality Classification, Mushroom Classification and Pyrimidine SAR (structure-activity relationship) had been considered for the Coursework. Also, the mountain car problem had been chosen for Reinforcement Learning.
